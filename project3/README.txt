In this project, I have designed and implemented a distance vector (DV) routing protocol. The first component of our protocol is a neighbor status detection subroutine which is based on ping/pong protocol. This subroutine is used to detect the liveliness of a neighbor and measure the rrt w.r.t the neighbor, thus generating DV update packets with up-to-date information. I then implemented the DV protocol by specifying how to update the forwarding table and distance vector based on the received DV routing update packet and how to broadcast the route changes with DV update packets. My DV protocol uses the poison reverse method to overcome the count-to-infinity problem. I assembled all these components in an event driven system where each subroutine is triggered within certain intervals, thus ensuring that the correctness of forwarding table on each router.
