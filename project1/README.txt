3 The average latency should be printed on the screen.

www mode testing:
1 setup server: ./server server_portnumber www .
2 setup client: type the following command in the browser:
3 Either the error message or file content should be visualized in your browser.

My method for measuring the non-bandwidth dependent network latency is reported in part3.pdf.
